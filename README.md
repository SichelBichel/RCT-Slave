RCT is a versatile remote control platform that allows you to send encrypted commands, launch applications, and trigger scripts on another device, instantly and securely. 

RCT operates through a master-slave architecture: the master device sends encrypted instructions, while the slave device listens for incoming commands and executes them based on predefined configurations. It's perfect for developers, system administrators, automation enthusiasts, or IT support teams who need reliable remote control without the overhead of full remote desktop solutions.

Its highly recommended to download the sourcecode and change the encryption keys before deploying this software. View the compiled found at https://rehoga-interactive.com/rct version as a demo.

In order to get this to work https://github.com/SichelBichel/RCT-Master is also needed.
